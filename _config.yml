# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
#   'bundle exec jekyll serve'.
# If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site Settings
# -------------------------------------
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title  }}, {{ site.email  }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable  }}.
