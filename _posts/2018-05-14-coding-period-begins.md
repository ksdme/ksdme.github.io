##### Bonding Period Ends
26 April 2018 - 13 May 2018

<br/><br/>
Now that the bonding period has finally come to an end, I thought
I should let you know about the developments during the period and
my plan ahead. Bonding Period is the time meant to help the students
get started with the community, coding practices and discuss the details
of the project one plans to follow with the community and their mentors.
I had a great time knowing the community and the interesting stuff they do.

<br/><br/>
> ##### Developments

1. **Resolved pending PR's**:
  I joined the coala community in late March and made a few
  contributions to projects.coala.io and coala-vs-code of
  which some were left pending in review. I got all of them
  resolved and merged.<br/><br/>

    1. [https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/60](https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/60)
    2. [https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/52](https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/52)
    3. [https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/32](https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/pull/32)

  <br/>

2. **Finish newcomer process**:
  Since the deadline was too close when I joined the community
  I was instrcuted to work on my proposal first and worry with
  the newcomer process later on. I have since completed the
  newcomer process.<br/><br/>

3. **Schedule**:
  I worked with my primary [@gaocegege](https://github.com/gaocegege)
  and we have decided on a week on week schedule that I should follow
  to stay on track.<br/><br/>

4. **Work flow**:
  We have discussed about the work flow I need to maintain and things
  such as tooling etc.<br/><br/>

5. **Project description update**:
  The project description page on [projects.coala.io](http://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=coala_language_server&lang=en)
  has been updated with the new milestones and the feature extensions
  that have been decided upon during this period.

<br/>The bonding period has helped me gain deeper understanding of the
project and the expected results. I am now eager to code my way
through.
